The spear will have physics (similar to an arrow)
if the spear dot product against a wall is angled
it will not stick but will bounce off instead, rendering it useless

spears stucked on a wall will despawn in 6 seconds
if still grabbing, forcefully drops you

spear angle to accept is in range of -+15 degrees
